**Teach Yo-Self Django**

***Group Members:*** Kathy, Kevon & Savannah

***1) What did you decide to learn today?***
    - Today we decided to begin learning Django

***2) Why did you want to learn it?***
    - We were interested in learning it for a few reasons. One member of the group is in the cybersecurity field where Python is a widely used language and learning every aspect is a good road to go down. Another members of the group were drawn to it due to the 'batteries included' aspect of the language in which many of the functionalities are already included and external libraries are not necessary. A third member has some experience and has taken python classes and wanted to get another chance to learn a facet of the language.
    
***3) What did you do to try and learn it? What process did you follow?***
    - We began with reviewing the lesson plan attached to the "Teach yourself" repo while trying to rebuild the tunr app. We also read some outside sources to help supplement the lesson and did a lot of trial and error within the code to attempt to get things working.
